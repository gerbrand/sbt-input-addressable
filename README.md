# sbt-input-addressable
Sbt plugin to calculate hash of source-code, or anything that is input for the build, to use as version. As inspired by blog-posting of Ruud van Asseldonk on [Build system insights](https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2018/09/03/build-system-insights)

TODO
* Create plugin, based on the documentation on https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Plugins.html (hello-world-plugin) and searching the web.
* Use [MessageDigest](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html) to create a hash.
